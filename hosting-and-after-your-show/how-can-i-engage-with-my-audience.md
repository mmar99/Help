# How can I engage with my audience?

### Giveaway

Use the gifting feature in the Popshop Live app and give something away to someone in your audience, live! This is a great way to promote the show and encourage your customers and fans in other channels to join you on Popshop Live. You can also pair this with engagement actions, like sharing the show, or following. For instance, every share of the show could be one entry into the draw, which occurs at the end of the show.

### Trivia show and games

Sprinkle in some trivia or other interactive games (hangman, Pictionary, etc) to entertain and engage your audience.

### Exclusive/limited edition product drops

Create a show tailored around an exclusive product, such as a limited brand or item or a one-of-a-kind work of art.

### Spotlight on your super fans

Using the [two-way calling feature](https://help.popshop.live/hc/en-us/articles/4409220757657) while live, call a fan from the audience and give them a live video call shout-out.

### Interviews / Q & A's / guest hosts

Using the two-way calling feature while live, bring in an outside person of interest. It could be a representative of a brand, a subject matter expert, a close friend or a guest host.
