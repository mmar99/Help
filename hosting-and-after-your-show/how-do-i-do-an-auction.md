# How do I do an auction?

When you are hosting a live show, Popshop Live gives you a number of interesting tools to help engage your audience and make sales. One of them is to host auctions on items.

**Key concepts:**

* **Auction** - the act of listing one of your items to be bid on by bidders in your live show. Auctions can only happen while you are hosting a live show on Popshop Live. Only one auction can be running at one time.
* **Timer**- an optional tool that allows you to add a timer to your auctions.&#x20;
* **Starting bid** - the minimum you are willing to take for the item. This is where the bidding price begins, this is also sometimes called a ‘floor price.’ We currently do not offer a reserve price.
* **A bidder -** someone from your audience who has placed a bid in the auction. You must have a Popshop Live account to bid.
* **Auction winner -** this is the bidder who had the highest bid when the auction is closed.
* **Sending the item -** once an auction finishes, the item is sent to the highest bidder. The highest bidder has to ‘accept’ the item to close the auction. Once the item is received, an order is created to fill after the show.
* **Finished auction -** once the item has been accepted by the highest bidder, the auction is finished.

Check out the step-by-step walk through below:

**Starting an auction -** auctions can only be started during a live show. To start an auction, click the three buttons on the bottom of the screen and then click “Auctions.” This is where you can see all of the previous auctions you have run during your live show. Click on a product from your inventory that you want to auction. This is where you can set the starting bid (also called floor price, or the minimum price you would take for the item).

**Starting an auction on an item not in your inventory -** it is better to pre-load items to your store inventory before doing a live show, but if you need to start an auction on an item not included in your inventory, follow the below steps.

* Click on the Add a product button
* List the item, including taking a product picture, giving it a title, and a price. For an auction item, set the ‘limit per user’ to 0. This will prevent a customer from purchasing it from your show catalog during your live show.
* Follow the steps above to complete an auction:

**⚡️New Feature⚡️: Timer**- This new feature will help you run your auctions more smoothly and help you pick a winner! Now, when you start a new auction, you can choose whether or not to add a timer. If you add a timer, customers will see a fun animation as the timer counts down. During the very last part of the auction, every bid that a customer places will add a little more time to the clock. When the clock runs out for good, the highest bidder wins!

**Additionally**, customers will need a credit card on file to place a bid. This will help further ensure that the winning bidder accepts their item.&#x20;

**Bidding on items -** when an auction starts, the item that is currently being auctioned off will appear at the top of the chat for the audience to see. When an audience member clicks on the auction, they are taken to the bidding screen. Use the + button to increase and customize the bid amount and long hold it to change the bid increment. When the bid is what you want, submit it by using the button on the right. The auction in the chat will change to the current highest bidder.

**Managing bids and bidders** - from time to time, you may want to remove a bid that a bidder has placed. To do this, just tap the auction on the live screen to see a record of all of the bids that have been placed. Long hold a bid to “Remove the bid” which will default to the next highest bidder. You can also use this to “Block User” which prevents that audience member from placing more bids in the case where a bidder is being intentionally disruptive or harmful to the auction.

**Finishing the auction -** when the bidding has concluded, it’s time to finish the auction. As the live auction host, you can finish the auction by asking for any last bids, using a timer in the background of your show. When you are ready, click on the auction and then “Finish Auction” to close the auction, and prevent more bids from being placed.

**⚡️New Feature⚡️: Canceling the auction**-  If for some valid reason you need to cancel an auction, click on the auction, and then use the three dots in the top right corner to cancel the auction. In this scenario, all placed bids are nulled, and the auction is removed from the live show.

**Sending the item -** when the auction is closed, the item is then sent to the highest bidder for purchase. You will see a confirmation screen confirming the details, including the final highest bid price, and who won. Once confirmed, the item will be sent to the highest bidder. The highest bidder will be notified in the Popshop Live app, and prompted to complete the purchase. Once the highest bidder accepts the item and pays for it, the auction is COMPLETED.

**What if the item isn’t accepted by the highest bidder? -** If the highest bidder doesn’t accept the item, then you as the host of the auction have the power to give the item to the next highest bidder. To do this, open the Seller Dashboard ([https://dashboard.popshop.live/](https://dashboard.popshop.live/)), navigate to the live show, and then use the “Auctions” tab to see all of the auctions you have done in your show. Click on the auction that you wish to pull back from the highest bidder. You can remove the send, and then return to the Popshop Live app to remove the highest bidder’s bid. This will default to the next highest bidder for that auction, and then the item can be sent to them.
