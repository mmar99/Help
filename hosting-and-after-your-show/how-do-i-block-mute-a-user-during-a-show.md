# How do I block/mute a user during a show?

### Muting a user

When a member of the audience sends disruptive, offensive, or generally hurtful comments, as the host, you can choose to mute or block that user from chatting during the rest of your show. The user can still make purchases and watch, but they will not be able to make more comments during the rest of your show.

To do this, locate the user on the comment thread and long-press over their username. A window will appear.&#x20;

Tap on the three dots and choose if you'd like to mute or block the user. Once selected you will get a confirmation that they have been muted for the rest of the show.&#x20;

⚡️The customer can still make purchases and watch, but they will not be able to make more comments during the rest of your show ⚡️

### Blocking a User

If you would prefer to ensure this customer can no longer engage in your shows in any way you can block them. When a customer is blocked, they cannot comment, purchase, send gifts, upvote, or follow you as a seller (view-only).

To block a user, locate the user on the comment thread and long-press over their username. A window will appear. Tap on the three dots and choose if you'd like to mute or block the user.&#x20;

### Blocking on Seller Dashboard

Blocking can also be done on your [Seller Dashboard](https://dashboard.popshop.live/) while you are live. You can select them under "viewers" and block them that way as well.&#x20;

If you would like to block someone and the show has ended you can block them on your Seller Dashboard under [Community>Members](https://dashboard.popshop.live/community/members)

If you change your mind, you can always choose to unblock them in [Community>Members>Blocked Users](https://dashboard.popshop.live/community/members/blocked).

If you block a user, please reach out to our [customer support team](mailto:support@popshop.live) to let them know the reason behind blocking them. We want to keep PSL a positive environment and we will flag their account.
