# How do I send a free gift or item?

During a live show, you can gift an item from your show catalog to a member of the audience. It's a great way to generate excitement and to use for giveaways.

⚠️ Reminder: You, as the sender of the free gift, will be responsible to pay for the shipping even if the recipient already has an open box, as gifting creates a new parent order ⚠️

To send a gift on the app:

1. Tap the three dots button in the bottom right-hand corner next to the camera button. From there a window will appear with multiple options, then tap "Send Item."
2. Your inventory will then show and you can select the item you would like to give.  \
