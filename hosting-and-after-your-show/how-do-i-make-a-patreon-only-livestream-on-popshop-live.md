# How do I make a Patreon-only livestream on Popshop Live?

Popshop Live has the ability to sync with Patreon so you can create patron-only shows! Now, before scheduling your show, be sure to contact [Seller@popshop.live](mailto:Seller@popshop.live) and request this feature to be turned on to your account.

Once the feature is turned on, all you have to make sure of is that when scheduling the show you toggle on the "Patreon Gate" button.&#x20;

This is a unique and fun way for you to engage with your subscribing fans on Patreon! Additionally, your fans will be able to sign in to PSL using their Patreon account.
