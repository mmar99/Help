# Can someone help me produce my show?

Anyone can host a live show using the Popshop Live app. However, having a producer, or someone else who helps during your show can be useful. Popshop Live offers the [Seller Dashboard](https://dashboard.popshop.live/) as the ultimate producer tool.

_Using_ [_Seller Dashboard_](https://dashboard.popshop.live/)_, a producer can help you interact with your audience, reply to specific messages in chat, view the show, add or remove products from your show catalog, or edit a product listing, like adding more units for sale or changing the price. They can also create a brand new product listing, create a discount to help drive more sales, and block any customers that may be disruptive during your show._

_To help produce a live show in the_ [_Seller Dashboard_](https://dashboard.popshop.live/) _go to Store > Shows. Click on the live show to enter into the producer view._

* **Listings** - use the listings tab to feature a product listing, edit a product listing, or add a product listing from your inventory to your show. You can also create a brand new product listing that will appear under "Inventory." Just tap on Store > Listings then follow the steps, and it will appear in the inventory section of the producer view.
* **Orders** - this tab allows you to see all orders that have occurred during your live show.
* **Comments** - this tab allows you to track all of the different comment types from your viewers (joins, shared, followed, purchase).
* **Viewers** - this tab shows all of the current viewers. If a viewer is being disruptive, you can tap on their name and block them from commenting. The viewer can still watch, and can still make purchases, but they cannot leave messages in the chat.

You can also get a direct link to your show from the producer view. This can help you promote the show in various channels while the show is live, without having to find it.
