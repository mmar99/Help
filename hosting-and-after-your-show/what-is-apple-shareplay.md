# What is Apple SharePlay?

SharePlay brings users together in an entirely new way by integrating your apps into FaceTime where you’re already connecting with your friends. With just one tap of the SharePlay icon at the top of your FaceTime call, you can start sharing your device’s screen with your friends or switch over to the Popshop Live app and tap on the SharePlay button at the bottom right of the homepage.

Here are just a few ways Popshop Live users can use Apple SharePlay:
