# What analytics can you provide sellers?

Sellers can access sales and engagement stats immediately after each show via our online web dashboard [here](https://dashboard.popshop.live/orders/all): the portal to manage your Popshop live seller account. Details such as likes, orders, viewers, and total earnings for the show can be viewed here. We will also email a post-show wrap up after each show with stats and recommendations to help your performance.
