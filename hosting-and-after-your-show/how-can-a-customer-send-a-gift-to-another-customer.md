# How can a customer send a gift to another Customer?

Sending gifts is very easy during a live show, you can instruct your customers or even share [this link](https://popshop.live/upcomingShow\_kHmEMWFCg4i56mwXsFaa) with them.&#x20;

⚠️ Reminder: The sender of the free gift will be responsible to pay for the shipping even if the recipient already has an open box, as gifting creates a new parent order ⚠️

You customer will be able to search for an item in your inventory or tap on the featured item you have up. From there they will tap on the present icon that's located next to the heart icon.&#x20;

A window will show with all the current viewers of the show, they can scroll through and find the user they would like to gift and tap "next"

This process will go a lot smoother if both sender and receiver have their contact and billing info already on file.&#x20;

Once selected your customer will tap "confirm" and the gift will be sent. The receiving customer will then accept the gift and a fun animation will show up letting everyone know in the chat that it was sent.

⚡️Pro tip: Once the item is sent it will be removed from the inventory regardless of whether the receiving customer accepts or not. They will have until the end of the show to cancel or accept, if the show ends and they have not accepted it, it will be refunded and restocked ⚡️
