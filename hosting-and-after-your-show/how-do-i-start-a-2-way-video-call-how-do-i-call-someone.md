# How do I start a 2-way video call? How do I call someone?

During your live show, you can call in a member of the audience to join your show. To do this, tap the three dots button in the bottom right-hand corner next to the camera button. From there a window will appear with multiple options, tap on "Start a Call".

You will have the option to call someone at random or select the individual you would like to call. Once selected hit "Next" and it will connect you! When they answer, their live video will appear above yours.
