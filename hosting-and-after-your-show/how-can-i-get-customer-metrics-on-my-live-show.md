# How can I get customer metrics on my live show?

If you're looking to find out how many comments, orders, new followers, new customers, or new viewers you have gotten in your last show this is how you can do it! They can all be found on your [Seller Dashboard](https://dashboard.popshop.live/).

Head to the [Shows Tab](https://dashboard.popshop.live/store/shows) on your Dashboard and find the show you would like to get the metrics of, click "view"

Once there you'll be able to see all of the metrics to your show and even be able to export to CSV file if needed.&#x20;
