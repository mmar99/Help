# How do I change my featured item on a show?

When your show is live, shoppers can see all the products added to your show by tapping on the product box. When a product listing is "featured" it appears in the product box on the bottom right-hand corner for all to see and you can control what product is shown there throughout the show.

To update tap on the "Add Products button" below the featured image. From there all of the items in your catalog will show up.

Select the item you would like to newly feature. An info window will appear for the product chosen. Confirm the information is correct and tap on "Save." This will now make that product featured.&#x20;
