# What are some show formats I can use in my show?

### Go live for one hour

Customers primarily purchase from your store when you're live, so the longer you're live, the more chance you'll increase viewers and sales. An hour may seem daunting, but you'll soon develop your live streaming muscle. (Some sellers on Popshop Live go live for 4-6 hours at a time, some even 24 hours at a time).

### Pick a consistent time slot

This will help condition your audience to expect your show and to tune in.

### Add 10-20 products to your show catalog

The more items you have to talk about, the easier it will be to go live longer.

### Keep it fresh from show to show

One of the most effective ways to grow your business on Popshop Live is getting your community to tune in again and again to your shows. So, consider changing up your setting, format, and product listings from show to show.

### Experiment adding product listings

Some sellers start their shows with no products in their show catalog and add them as they go. Others have all of the products in their show catalog at the start. Use whatever technique works best for you and be consistent
