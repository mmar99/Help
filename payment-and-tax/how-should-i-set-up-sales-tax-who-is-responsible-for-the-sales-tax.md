# How should I set up sales tax? Who is responsible for the sales tax?

Currently, each seller is responsible for reporting and submitting taxes to the IRS.&#x20;

During the initial setup of your seller profile, you must input the sales tax for the region/state you are in. Unless you're in a state that does not collect a sales tax (Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, or Oregon) it is recommended that you add it.

If you are in one of those states that collect sales tax and you do not pay/report the sales tax it will then be collected during your tax return so we suggest preemptively adding it.&#x20;

To add your sales tax head to your profile > Settings > Taxes

All payouts include tax, and you can export your taxes at the end of each year by going on your [seller dashboard](https://dashboard.popshop.live/store/commerce/taxes) and downloading the CSV file.
