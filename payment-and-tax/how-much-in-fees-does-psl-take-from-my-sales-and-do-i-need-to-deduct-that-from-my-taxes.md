# How much in fees does PSL take from my sales and do I need to deduct that from my taxes?

We take 13% (10% commission + 3% payment processing fee). We pass on the full tax amount to you. The 3% payment processing fee is taken from the full customer paid amount (eg. item + sales tax + shipping cost). The 10% does not include sales tax.
