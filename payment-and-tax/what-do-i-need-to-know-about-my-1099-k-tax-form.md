# What do I need to know about my 1099-K tax form?

The IRS requires Popshop Live to provide all US-based sellers with a 1099-K form to report their sales and earnings from the calendar year. If your sales exceed $600 during the calendar year, Popshop Live is legally obligated to report your sales to the US government.

To ensure an accurate 1099-K, we need to have a record of your W-9 taxpayer information on file.

We have partnered with [Tax1099](https://www.tax1099.com/) to automate this process and to secure your taxpayer information safely.

To submit this information, please visit the seller dashboard at [Finances -> Payments](https://help.popshop.live/hc/en-us/articles/dashboard.popshop.live/finances/payments)
