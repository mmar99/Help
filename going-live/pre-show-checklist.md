# Pre show checklist

Here are some device and production tips to help your show run smoothly:

* **Get your device ready to go live** - make sure your device is fully charged and keep it charging during your show. Below 20% or at Low Power mode will impact your device's ability to stream, so consider using a backup mobile battery to keep your device charged. Close all other apps on your phone that may be running in the background.
* **Check your WiFi strength** - make sure your device is connected to WiFi when possible. We recommend testing your WiFi using a website like [speedtest.net](http://speedtest.net/). We recommend a minimum **upload** speed of 5 mbps.
* **Check your lighting, sound and how your shot is framed** - having good lighting, sound and framing will greatly improve the look and feel of your show. Check in practice mode. Consider using a tripod, a gimbal or another tool to hold your camera during your show.

**Background and set recommendations**

Having a good background for your live show can make a big difference to your audience and can actually help you sell more. Here are a few tips for your show's background:

* Avoid having clutter in the background.
* Consider having a shelf or rack with products on it (even products you might not plan on covering). A customer might ask to see one, allowing you to more than likely make a sale.
* If you are showing off items on a desk, make sure you have a clean and organized desk.
* Depending on your show format and whether you have a helper, consider how you are going to manage interactions with the audience. Try not to be so far away from your camera, or use another device to read the chat, thank your customers who make purchases, and thank customers who follow or share your show with their friends.
* Avoid wearing white if possible (the shirt might blend in with the chat box, making it hard to see for shoppers).
* (Optional) If youâ€™re playing music, test audio before hand and mark the volume setting so your voice and interactions aren't drowned out by the music. Remember to please respect artists and play royalty free music.
* (Optional) As you improve going live over time, consider using multiple sets and different backdrops where you can move your camera around. This can give the audience a new area and it's like being in a new show (for instance, going to a new part of your store).

**Having a partner or a helper -** one of the best ways to improve your live shows is to recruit a helper or someone to help produce the show with you. Recruiting a co-worker, or a friend to help can make a big difference.

_If you choose to work with another person, they can produce your show using the_ [_Seller Dashboard_](https://dashboard.popshop.live/) _by tapping on Store > Shows and then tapping on your live show. Here they can see the chat messages and interactions, they can add product listings from your store inventory to your show's product catalog, re-arrange products and help with any technical issues that can arrive._

**Practice mode -** use practice mode in the Popshop Live app to practice and test a live show before you actually go live for customers to see. We recommend practicing in advance of the day of your show to help calm your nerves and to anticipate anything that could distract you.

_To use practice mode, go to your seller profile in the Popshop Live app by tapping on your store profile picture. Tap on the "Go Live" icon and then toggle the show to "Practice mode." You can share the direct link with yourself, a coworker or friend to safely test things like lightning, sound and WiFi connection in the location you plan to conduct your show from._
