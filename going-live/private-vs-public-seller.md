# Private vs Public Seller

All Sellers on Popshop Live start as "private", which means that anyone following you or having access to your store URL will be able to view your shows and purchase from you. As a new seller, your first goal (aside from properly setting up your storefront) is to reach 30 referrals. Once you get 30 referrals, your store is eligible to level up on Popshop Live and unlock a number of exciting benefits! These benefits are to help you continue to grow your business and get more exposure on our platform.

What do you unlock once you've hit that goal?

* A custom handle for your store (depending on availability) - [www.popshop.live/dogsarecool](http://www.popshop.live/dogsarecool)
* Your shows are eligible to appear on high visibility placements on Popshop Live, like our category or featured row.
* You will be able to participate in events on Popshop Live.
* You will get access to create your first badge! This can help you to continue to grow and engage your community. As you keep growing on Popshop Live, we will give you more badges to work with.

The secret to growing your business on Popshop Live is to continue to invest in and grow your community. 30 referrals is a great first milestone, but our best sellers never stop referring customers to their store and have 1000s of referrals. The more people who come to support you, the more fun for others who discover you for the first time.&#x20;

If you are unsure about how many referrals you currently have you can easily check by tapping on your profile image at the top-right corner of the app and then tapping on Settings > Referrals.
