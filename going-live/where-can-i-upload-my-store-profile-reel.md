# Where can I upload my store profile reel?

Your store profile reel will live in your store and play whenever there is no upcoming show preview video. This, similar to a preview reel, should inform the audience who you are, what you sell and/or highlight your host.&#x20;

To upload your profile reel head over to your [Seller Dashboard>Store>Info](https://dashboard.popshop.live/store/info) and upload the preview reel there.&#x20;

When making your video, keep in mind that less is more! Here are some tips to follow when making your preview video:

1. Keep it short!  Around 20 seconds is the perfect length.&#x20;
   1. Background music is not required but suggested.
   2. You can record the preview video right on your phone or upload it from your library.
2. Be sure to highlight the host, main product, or any upcoming promos.&#x20;
   1. You can let them know what your next show will be all about while showing off some of the great products you have.
3. Have fun with your video and get creative.
   1. We have seen that the more energy and excitement you put into these videos the more your customers get hype too.
   2. Feel free to use other programs to add visuals and voice overlays to the video.
4. Update your store favorites to reflect your upcoming show.
   1. This is a great way to get some additional sales and give a preview of products to your customers.&#x20;
