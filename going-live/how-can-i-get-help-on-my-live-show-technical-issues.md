# How can I get help on my live show? Technical issues

If you run into issues with your device, your internet connectivity, or just general technical problems while you are live, this could be caused by having other apps open on your device, or by not being connected to WiFi. When you face these sorts of technical issues, rather than choosing to end the show, you can try to resolve the issue by force quitting the Popshop Live app. The app is designed to pause your live show when you force quit.

Additionally, on the “Actions” menu button you will now be able to request help during your live shows. Once you tap on “help” a request will be sent to the Popshop Live team and someone will arrive at your show to assist.&#x20;
