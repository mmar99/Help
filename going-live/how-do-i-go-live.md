# How do I go live?

Although we recommend scheduling a show 7-days in advance and promoting it to maximize attendance, you can start a live show at any time on the Popshop Live app.

To start a live show, go to your store profile by tapping on your profile photo. Tap the Live icon and follow the steps in the app to set-up your live show. Once filled out tap "next"

* **Choose a scheduled show** - after tapping to "Go Live", select shows you have created and scheduled in advance. Selecting an upcoming show will create your live show using the same link. If you do not want to create your live show using a previously scheduled show, just tap "Skip" in the top right corner and then continue.
*   **Prac**_**tice mode** - "practice" mode is an option you can toggle on when setting up your live show. When you toggle practice mode on, only people with the direct link to the live show (provided in the next step) can see the live show and the show will not be discovered anywhere else on Popshop Live. This is a great way to practice with the live show functionality._

    _⚡️If you set up a scheduled show in practice mode, that show cannot be made fully visible. Similarly, if you created a scheduled show created "visible" cannot be made practice.⚡️_\

*   **Adding a product** - in order to go live, you have to have a product listing in your store's inventory. Learn about adding a product to your store's inventory.\


    _⚡️You can choose to add a product or products to your live show by clicking the green "+" button. It's up to you whether to start your show with no product listings, a few product listings and add more as you go, or to add all of the products you plan to discuss during your live show during this step.⚡️_

**The Greenroom** - the final step before going full live is entering the greenroom. You are not live for your audience to see, so this is your chance to check the details of your live show, like the product listings you have chosen to start your show off with, your show title, as well as your lighting and sound. When you are ready, tap to "Go Live", wait for the 5-4-3-2-1 count down, and then you're live and engaging with your audience!
