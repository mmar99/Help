# How do I share my live show?

During your live show, you can share it via SMS Text, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, email, or by copying the link to share. To do this, tap on the middle "Share" icon at the top right corner, and a menu will show up at the bottom of your screen with the options to share.&#x20;
