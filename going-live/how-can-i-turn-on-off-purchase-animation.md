Shopping on Popshop Live is designed to be exciting, fun and exhilarating for you and your audience. Purchase animations, liking bolts and chat all make for an exciting experience. However, we know that for some sellers or certain drops, these may become burdensome or overwhelming.

That's why we launched the ability for a customer to choose to turn these off while watching your show.

Here's how it works: customers can hard press the liking bolt button and they will get an option menu: turn off purchase animations, turn off liking bolts, turn off chat. When a customer toggles these off, then on their screen, they will only see their own purchase animation, their own liking bolt clicks, and they won't see chat at all. This allows them to watch your show without these elements. Everyone else will still see these features on.

Customers have to select this for every show, so if they join your show on another day, or another show on Popshop Live, they will need to re-submit their selection.
