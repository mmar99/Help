# How do I edit my store profile and information?

The first step to selling on Popshop Live is setting up your store. It comes with a unique URL and unique invite code that you can share, found under "Store" in the [Seller Dashboard](https://dashboard.popshop.live/). Other elements of your store:

* **Store info:** edit these details anytime in the [Seller Dashboard](https://dashboard.popshop.live/) or in the Popshop Live app by tapping your profile picture in the top right corner and then "Edit"
* **Store profile photo** and **Store name:** appear when you enter a show, and in search results for your store
* **Bio:** add information about you and your store, and what you sell on Popshop Live
* **Announcement:** a space for you to leave updates and messages, visible to anyone that visits your seller profile
* **Store reel:** a short video about your store that plays when customers visit your storefront when you aren't live or when you do not have any upcoming shows

Before your first live show, you will need to complete additional business information on your store profile:

* **Business Location:** this name will appear in your shipping labels
* **Payout:** how you would like us to pay you. We recommend ACH.
* **Shipping Options**
* **Taxes:** what % you collect when customers purchase from you, based on where your business is located. (If you have nexus status in additional states, you are able to input different %'s for different states).
