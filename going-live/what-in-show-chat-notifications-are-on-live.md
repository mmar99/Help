# What In-show chat notifications are on Live?

**Purchase notification** - when a customer makes a purchase from your show catalog, you and the rest of the audience will get a notification in the show. Make sure to celebrate and thank customers when they make purchases from your show.

**New customer notification** - you get notified when someone new has joined your show. We always recommend saying hi, but this is a great opportunity to really roll out the red carpet! Here are some ideas to welcome the person to join your community on Popshop Live.

1. Offer to send a free gift with purchase
2. Welcome them to let you know if they see something they like. Consider using the "send item" feature to send it to them at a lower price.
3. Use the Seller Dashboard show recap and throw in a personal note in their package
4. Send them a Thank You video after your show!

_⚡️_New joiners can become customers and or followers. which can help you grow your community on PSL. Welcome them with open arms! _⚡️_

**Follow notifications** - your audience can follow you during your live show. When they follow you, they become eligible to see your shows on Popshop Live and will receive notifications when you go live in the future. Remind your audience to follow you during your show, and make sure to mention when your next show will be.

_⚡️When a customer in the audience follows you, you and everyone else in the audience will get a message in the show. Thank your new followers by name and it may help others in the audience to also follow you.⚡️_

**Turn off show animations** - similar to how customers can turn off the animations on their side, now sellers can too. Head to “broadcast settings” in the bottom right corner of your live steam and you’ll be able to turn on/off the animations
