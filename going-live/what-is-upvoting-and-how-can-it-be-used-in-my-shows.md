# What is upvoting and how can it be used in my shows?

Upvote or Upvoting is a chat feature that your audience can use during your live shows to show support, bring attention to a question, and/or emphasize another viewer’s comment. Viewers can tap on any comment in the chat and select “Upvote,” this will bounce the comment to the top of the chat and keep it there for a few seconds. Each time a viewer upvotes that comment it will stay at the top of the chat for a little longer.

This feature is great not only for increasing engagement, encouraging viewer-viewer celebration, and connections but also for you, as sellers, to easily spot popular questions, comments, answers to polls, purchases, shares, and gifts!

⚡️Please note: Customers can upvote a specific comment **ONCE**⚡️

### 2 ways to upvote
