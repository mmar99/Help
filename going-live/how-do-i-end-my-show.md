# How do I end my show?

To end your live show, tap on the three dots in the bottom right corner of the show and tap "End Show." Once confirmed you will get a confirmation "That's a wrap" screen.&#x20;

A couple of best practices before ending your show:

* Say "thank you" to the audience and all of the customers who made purchases.
* Tell the audience when your next show on Popshop Live will be.
* Ask your new customers to follow your storefront so that they receive notifications the next time you schedule your show, and the next time you go live.
* Ask any customers to leave a product review once they receive their order from you.
