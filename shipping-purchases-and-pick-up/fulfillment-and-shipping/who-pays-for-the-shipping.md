# Who pays for the shipping?

Shipping is paid by customers when they purchase items from your show. We currently charge a flat-rate shipping cost of $5.99. Since there is no shopping cart in a Popshop Live show, the customer pays the shipping amount only once on their first product purchase. All subsequent purchases they make during your show, and up to 12 hours after your show ends, are covered by this one shipping price.
