# How do I allow store pickup orders?

If you would like to offer a pickup option to local customers please follow the next steps:

*
  * Email [support ](mailto:support@popshop.live)to request pickup to be activated on your seller account. **Note: you will not see the below unless you reach out to Popshop Live to enable pickup on your account.**
  * Once enabled, [go to your store settings in Seller Dashboard](https://dashboard.popshop.live/settings), click "Add +" under ‘Pickup’  to input the Pickup location information (in case this is different than your shipping location). **Use the notes field for any special instructions and pickup hours.**

⚡️Note**:** you can also do this in the Popshop Live app. In the show settings, you will see ‘Add Pickup Address’ in the app. You will not be able to start a Pickup show without first selecting a ‘Pickup Address.⚡️

* At the start of each show, you can decide if you want to do shipping only, pickup only, or pickup + shipping show

⚡️Please note if you do not select "Storefront" or "Live Storefront" your customers will **NOT** be able to pick up their orders⚡️

At checkout, your customers will see the option to toggle their shipping address to ‘Pickup.’ They won’t be charged shipping, and their order will be marked for ‘Pickup’ in our ordering system. The instructions and your Pickup address will be used to inform the customer about where and how to pick up their orders.

**Fulfilling Pickup Orders**

At the end of your show, your orders will appear in the Seller Dashboard like normal. However, you will notice four subtabs under the ‘Orders’ tabs: [All](https://dashboard.popshop.live/orders/all) (which has all orders, not grouped by show), [Shipping](https://dashboard.popshop.live/orders/shows/live) (which has orders needing to be shipped grouped by show), [Pickup](https://dashboard.popshop.live/orders/shows/storefront) (which has orders grouped by the show that need to be picked up by customers) and [Store Favorites](https://dashboard.popshop.live/orders/featured) (which has any Store Favorites orders you have received).

Your shows will appear in each tab like normal, and you can click on each tab to begin fulfilling the orders (orders that need to be shipped for your show in the ‘Shipping’ tab and pickup orders in the Pickup tab).

⚡️Note: if you selected “Live Shopping + Pickup” for your show (so customers can either choose to pickup OR ship), that show will appear in both the Pickup and the Shipping tabs (you will only see shipping orders in the Shipping tab, and vice versa for Pickup Orders in the Pickup tab)⚡️

Pickup is similar to Popshop Live’s shipping framework, there is no ‘cart’ and so each purchase is a unique order. We group these unique orders together into a single-parent entry when it’s time to fulfill. So during a show, when a customer selects ‘Pickup’ for 5 items, those items will appear in a single entry in the ‘Pickup’ dashboard.

⚡️Note: if a customer selects an item for pickup, and one for shipping, this will generate 2 orders: one that appears in the ‘Pickup’ queue for the show, and one that appears in the ‘Shipping’ queue for that show.⚡️

### Pickup order statuses:

1. **All** - these are all orders, regardless of their status for this show. This is the best label for troubleshooting since you can search across statuses.
2. **Open -** these are all orders that have been placed during the show, but are not ‘Closed.’ If a customer buys something else during the show, the item will be added to this order.
3. **New** - the order is finished and is ready to pack.
4. **Processing** - this means you started packing it (it can help if multiple people pack orders to track which have been started packing, and so that the same order isn’t packed twice)
5. **Packed/Ready for pickup** - this means it’s packed and ready for pickup. When an order enters this status, we will notify the customer that they can come to pick it up. We will include your pickup location + your added directions in the order confirmation and notifications.

&#x20;            6\. **Completed** - when the customer comes and picks up their order, you can mark the order                        as "Complete." This closes the order.

You can move an order through the flow in a few ways: in bulk by selecting the orders manually, or one-by-one by clicking on the order to see the details. We also provide a packing slip, which can be used to pack and then appended to the bag or box you use for the items. In each status, you can search for the Order ID (the customer will see this in the email and in their Popshop Live account) or use their First and Last name.&#x20;
