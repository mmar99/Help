# PSL Shipping vs Own Shipping, which one is best for me?

There are two ways you can set up your shipping on Popshop Live. You can use PSL shipping or opt-in to do your own shipping. **Each comes with its own details and specifications**. Please read below the differences in order to make the best decision for your store.

### PSL Shipping (Open Box):&#x20;

* USPS Priority $5.99 is automatically turned on in your store
  * Your package will be insured for up to $50, however, if your item requires a higher insurance premium we recommend increasing the insurance policy with USPS.&#x20;
  * **You will be responsible for contacting and purchasing any additional policies with USPS**&#x20;
* Visible under settings in your [Seller Dashboard](https://dashboard.popshop.live/)
* Customers are only charged one time for shipping (open box). They will be charged $5.99 for their first purchase and then every other purchase afterward within the show will not be charged shipping
* Customers have 12 hours from their first purchase in the live show to take advantage of the open box shipping- if you have store favorites they can purchase outside of the show and will not be charged additional shipping as long as they are making the purchase within 12 hours of the original in show purchase
* If you use PSL shipping, labels will be automatically generated after 12 hours, sellers will need to use these labels to package their orders. Once packages are scanned by USPS, the funds will be released from pending to available balance in the seller dashboard under the commerce tab&#x20;

### Arrange my own shipping

* Customers are charged the amount established by the seller every time they make a purchase (if the box next to arrange my own shipping says $5, they will be charged $5 **every time** they make a purchase… **5 items purchased = $25 on shipping**).&#x20;
* All of this money is directly made available in the [Seller Dashboard](https://dashboard.popshop.live/) so the seller may use the funds to purchase shipping labels&#x20;
* If you toggle on “arrange my own shipping” and leave the charge at $0, customers will not be charged anything for shipping and no shipping related fees will be passed to you as the seller to use for generating your own shipping labels

Pro Tip ⚡️: Sometimes sellers have items that are larger than 5lbs and 12x11x10 (USPS priority box dimensions) and will **need to generate their own shipping label**. Sellers have the ability to use PSL’s $5.99 open box and add additional shipping charges to certain items that require extra labels. If you edit an item under inventory, you will see a “Flat Rate Shipping” button. If you have PSL Shipping turned on, **these will all automatically be turned off**. If you toggle “Flat Rate Shipping” on and add the specific shipping cost for that item, customers will be charged $x while purchasing that item.&#x20;

Example: If I purchase from a store that has PSL Shipping turned on, I will be charged $5.99 for the first item and then $0 for every item after that. If I purchase the item during that same livestream, I will be charged $7 as that’s the cost the seller inputted for the item.&#x20;
