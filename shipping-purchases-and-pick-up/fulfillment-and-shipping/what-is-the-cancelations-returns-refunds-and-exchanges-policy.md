# What is the cancelations, returns, refunds and exchanges policy?

**Q: What is the cancellation / refund / returns policy?**

A: Due to the style of shopping and limited inventory, all sales are final. The checkout process is two steps for customers to see what was selected and to review the product they are purchasing before hitting the buy button. It's best to remind your customers of the no cancelations policy during the show.

* An exception to this, is if there is a glitch or error in the app and an item is purchased in rapid succession. This typically results in a duplicate purchase of an item. We will handle those refunds per customer requests.

**Q: What happens if a customer receives a damaged item?** A: If a customer receives a damaged item, we ask them to share a photo of the damaged item which we will share with Sellers. The photo is used to verify the packaging of the item and the box the item was received in. This helps understand if the item was packaged properly or if the item was mishandled by the carrier. Once our Support team shares that with you, let us know how you would like to proceed with the item.\
\
If the packaging was not sufficient, the seller is expected to provide a promo code to be used on a future purchase, to re-ship the item purchased, or to offer a refund if the customer does not accept either of the former options. \
\
If the products were damaged due to mishandling by a carrier - the package is insured for $50 and our team will file a claim with USPS for the damaged order. We will refund the customer for the full amount of the goods and we will extend the $50 insurance to the seller. If you're concerned about the insurance not covering the cost of the items being shipped, you're able to use your own labels on higher priced items and can make sure when purchasing your own labels to add additional insurance.

Please note:

* If you would like us to refund the customer, let us know and we will handle it.
* If you would like to send the customer a new, undamaged item it is the Seller's responsibility to ship the replacement item at no cost to the customer.
* If you would like the customer to send the item back before handling the refund, you can either provide the customer with a shipping label or ask them to send the item back to your address. PSL does not provide any return/exchange labels.

**Q: What happens if a customer is missing an item?** A: If a customer receives their order and is missing an item, Sellers can either ship the missing item to the customer, at no cost to the customer. Or we can refund the customer for the missing item.

**Q: What happens if you oversell an item?** A: If you oversell an item, let our customer support team know and we will let the customer know that the item was out of stock and refund their card.

**Q: Who pays for the refund?** A:Once the refund is processed it will be taken out of the payout/balance.&#x20;
