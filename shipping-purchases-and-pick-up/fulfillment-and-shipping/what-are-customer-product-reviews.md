# What are customer product reviews?

When a customer receives an order from your store, they have the option to leave you a product review video. This is a short animated video of the product, along with a rating. Videos from customers appear on your store under "Reviews" for other customers to see. We recommend you encourage your customers to leave you a product review as it's a great way for new customers to see what you sell and also see how your super fans rate your products and service.
