# How do customers buy my products?

During a live show, customers can browse your products and make purchases using Apple Pay, a credit card, or a debit card—they’ll continue to hear your show’s audio as they step through a simple, two-tap checkout process. We recommend that sellers advise their viewers to set up their payment details in their profile at the beginning of a show. This avoids disappointment if a product sells out quickly.
