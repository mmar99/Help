# How soon after the show should I ship my orders?

Orders should ship within 1-3 business days. If you know it will take longer than 3 business days for your order to ship please let us and your customers know. Payout will be available once the order has been shipped, and the “Available Balance” in your profile will be updated.

If you need to contact us or need help with shipping/contacting a customer, please reach out to [support@popshop.live](mailto:support@popshop.live) and they can open a ticket to assist you.&#x20;
