# How do I fulfill orders on Seller Dashboard? (PSL Shipping)

After your live show, it’s important to quickly fulfill orders. Customers who receive their orders in less than 5 business days are more likely to be happy and spend more at your store. When you use Popshop Live shipping, if the orders leave your business address within 3 business days, the orders will arrive to customers within 5 business days. **The Seller Dashboard is the premier place to help you fulfill your orders.** In this guide, we will walk you through how to fulfill your orders on Popshop Live along with some of the key concepts.

### **Where can I see the orders I need to fulfill?**

We recommend using the Shipping section of the Seller Dashboard and fulfilling the orders from your most recent show before moving on to a new show.

1. Go to the shipping tab on your Seller Dashboard [here](https://dashboard.popshop.live/orders/shows/shipping) and click on the show you would like to fulfill the orders.&#x20;

2. Select the customers you would like to generate the orders or select all by clicking on the collective "select all" box at the top of the orders

      1. If you have printed on normal printing paper, be sure to fold/cut down to size
5. Physically package your individual orders. Reference your packing slip to organize each individual's shipment or view individual orders on your Seller Dashboard
   1. Pro tip: Be sure to secure each shipping label to their package using label stickers, a clear envelope sticker, or clear packing tape.&#x20;

On the orders screen, you will see all of the orders that have been placed during that show. Here is what the different statuses mean:

**Label status -** there are three options:

* **Flat rate** - this means that you elected to provide **your own shipping method** for this item. You are responsible for creating a label and adding the tracking number to Popshop Live.
* **Opened -** this status is for orders where PSL shipping was selected. This status means that the customer’s box is still open. If they place an order from your store (Under Store Favorites), they won’t pay for shipping and the item(s) they buy will be added to this order. Orders stay open for 12 hours from when they are placed. You can override and generate the labels, but by doing this, the open box closes, and customers have to pay for shipping again.
* **Generated** - this means that the label is generated. The order is closed, and the label can be printed, packed, and the order shipped.

**Shipping status -** this is where the order is in the shipping process.

* **Pre-transit** - means the label is printed but not scanned
* **In- transi**t - means it’s on the way
* **Delivered** - means it was scanned out and dropped off.

**Order status -** this is the status of the order, there are two options: completed, or unshipped. This column is primarily used to filter to see anything that isn’t completed. When orders get completed, this is when those funds are available for payout.

**Packed -** this is blank and isn’t required. If you have a lot of orders, or multiple people are helping fulfill, you can mark an order as ‘Packed.’ This means you packed it, and it’s ready for drop off at USPS, etc.

#### **Picklist**

A picklist is a list of the items you sold during the show along with the quantities. This can help you gather all of the items that are going to be on individual packing slips but do it all at once. For instance, if your items are in your warehouse, but you pack in the office, use the picklist to go grab everything you will need from the warehouse and bring it in bulk to the office.
