# Can I cancel my order?

We will always do our best to try and avoid any cancelations. We will remind any customers that reach out about the cancelation policy, but we will also reach out to you to see if an exception can be made. We don't get many cancelation requests. We do not want to always just bluntly say no. It's a poor experience for a customer. And there may be times where Sellers make an exception.
