# How do I know if a product was purchased?

When a product is purchased you will see an animation pop up onscreen once the payment is completed. You will also see a purchase notification in the comments thread and a change in quantity will be reflected in your inventory. A “Sold Out” label will show up if the quantity of a product reaches 0 (you can restock a product at any point during the show by increasing its quantity).
