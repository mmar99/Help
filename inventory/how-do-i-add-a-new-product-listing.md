# How do I add a new product listing?

**Start by creating a product listing by tapping on "Add a Product" and then complete these steps:**

* **Image:** upload a photo
* **Product Name:** add a quick title for the product (i.e. Toy Story Alien 400/100 Be@rbrick)
* **Price:** input how much you want to sell that item for
* **Discount Price:** you can add a discount animation (a strikethrough)
* **Description (optional):** add a short description that a customer will see when they click on your listing. It doesn't have to be detailed, as customers often make the decision to purchase via your video.
* **Quantity:** input how many units of this item you have for sale
* **Add variant:** use this option to create different sizes, colors or variations of a product

Advanced Settings

* **Shipping**
  * **SKU (optional):** you can use existing SKUs from your other channels to make fulfilling orders easier
  * **Flat shipping toggle off**: you are by default using Popshop Live's shipping ($5.99 USPS Priority Mail, 5lbs 12 x 11 x 10).
  * **Flat Rate shipping toggle on:**  by choosing this option you will be responsible for the handling and shipping of this item. This is preferred for larger items and heavy items.
* **Max Purchase:** toggling this allows you to limit how many of the items that one single customer can purchase within your show.

**Show Catalog:** you choose product listings from your "Inventory" that you will sell during your live show, your "Show Catalog", during the "Going Live" process in the Greenroom. We recommend starting with some product listings, and then you can add to your store either via your "Inventory" with pre-uploaded product listings or by "Adding on the Fly".
