# How do I bulk discount my Show Catalogue?

Everyone loves a discount. But if you're like me, you can’t help a deal that is only 10 minutes long! ⏰

One hosting tip is to start a show with 10% off for 10 minutes. These rewards customers that join early and overcome the hurdle of paying for shipping with the first purchase.

**To bulk discount all the products in your show:**

1. Navigate to the [Seller Dashboard](https://dashboard.popshop.live/) during a live show. Then click "Shows" on the left-hand side. From there find your live show and click "view"&#x20;
