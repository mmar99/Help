# Can my sold out items be automatically removed from my live show?

When stuff sells out, your items can now be set to go to the bottom of you inventory list.

This is especially helpful when you have a large catalog. This little easter egg in [Seller Dashboard](https://dashboard.popshop.live/store/shows) does just that. Itâ€™s optional, defaulted to OFF, and has to be configured **each** show once you are live.

1. Head to your live show on [Seller Dashboard](https://dashboard.popshop.live/store/shows). Scroll down and click on "Bulk actions"

4\.  Click "OK" to confirm
