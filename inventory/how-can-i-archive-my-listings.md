# How can I archive my listings?

You can now archive your listings. When a listing is archived, it doesnâ€™t appear in your show catalog and can be filtered from your store inventory. As part of this release, we also launched logic where SKU becomes the unique identifier for a listing. No two listings can have the same SKU moving forward.

Head to your seller Dashboard and under "inventory" you'll be able to archive any listing.
