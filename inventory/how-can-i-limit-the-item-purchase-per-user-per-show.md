# How can I limit the item purchase per user / per show?

For each of the items in your inventory, you'll have the ability to control in the [Seller Dashboard](https://dashboard.popshop.live/store/listings) the limit purchase per user or per show.&#x20;

Limit Purchase Per User- If this toggle is **ON** and a number is set, a user will only be able to purchase that item the amount given. This is for a lifetime.&#x20;

Maximum Purchase Quantity Per User Per Live Stream- If this toggle is **ON** and a number is set, your customer will only be allowed to purchase that amount of items for the show's entirety. If the item is on another show, they will be able to purchase it there as well.&#x20;
