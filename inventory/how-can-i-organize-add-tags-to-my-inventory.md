# How can I organize / add tags to my inventory?

Head [here](https://dashboard.popshop.live/store/listings) to add tags to your inventory items. To help you find items quickly you are able to add tags to your inventory items. Then, once you are live you will be able to filter using these tags to make it easier to find.&#x20;

Find your inventory on the seller dashboard and click on the three dots at the top-right corner of the item. Click "edit tags".
