# Can I fulfill via my Shopify?

Order sync sends product orders on Popshop Live back to your Shopify account. This is intended for if you utilize a complicated 3rd Party logistics company or software integrated with Shopify to fulfill your orders.

The order payments are processed on Popshop Live and contribute to your balance, but the items and quantities and customer shipment information are passed to Shopify. Once you fulfill the item in Shopify, the tracking information is automatically ported back into Popshop Live so your customers on Popshop Live know the status of your order.

This option will not charge any shipping to customers, so either you will be paying the shipping cost or need to add an item that customers can purchase to pay for shipping.
