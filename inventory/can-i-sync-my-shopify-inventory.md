# Can I sync my Shopify Inventory?

Shopify Sync is an easy way to import inventory from your existing Shopify store and to keep inventory quantities up to date. If you set this up, your Shopify product quantities will be updated in real-time when a purchase is made on Popshop Live.

Please note it is not an order and fulfillment sync unless you set that up separately (see article here) once you have completed these steps.&#x20;

**Here is how to set this Inventory Sync up:**

1. Log on to your Popshop Live Seller Dashboard [here](https://dashboard.popshop.live/store/listings)&#x20;
   1. Go to Inventory> Shopify Sync
   2. ![mceclip4.png](https://help.popshop.live/hc/article\_attachments/4409472668569/mceclip4.png)
   3. Click Connect&#x20;
   4. ![mceclip5.png](https://help.popshop.live/hc/article\_attachments/4409472669721/mceclip5.png)
   5. Enter the first half of your Shopify URL
      1. Example: Xyzbrand.myshopify.com

   2. A note on Locations:&#x20;
      1. You can either 1) sync directly with your Shopify storeâ€™s primary location OR 2) create a dedicated location in Shopify where you allocate inventory to Popshop Live.&#x20;
      2. **For stores with lots of inventory quantity**, option 1), connecting directly to your primary location is recommended
      3. **For stores with limited inventory,** drop items, etc we recommend option 2), transferring inventory from your primary Shopify Store to a location dedicated to Popshop Live. Our inventory sync with Shopify has a system delay of 8 seconds to update quantity and we don't want to risk overselling.
      4. We support Pietra fulfillment Locations.
3. Back on Dashboard, go to your inventory/Shopify sync.&#x20;
   1. Click on the photos of items you want to import&#x20;
   2. You will know that it is accepted once itâ€™s been greyed out with a purple tick

4. Any time you have new inventory on your Shopify, come to the Shopify Sync page and repeat step 4
5. Set up is complete ðŸ™Œ
