# How do I add a social media template to my instagram?

Utilizing our social media templates to promote your business on Instagram is a great way to build momentum and bring some of your followers to join your shows. Here is a guide on how best to create these stories.

**Before starting, it will be helpful to have these things already on your phone:**

* Your Logo (JPG, PNG)
* Your User Code
* Product photos (Organizing these in a separate photos folder can be useful for quick location)
* Show details (Time and date)
* Social media templates (found here)

**How to overlay your seller referral code on a template:**

1. Select the “+” button at the top of your Instagram screen and select “Story”. From there, your camera roll should appear where you can select the template you would like to use. \*If you have saved templates to a folder, you can tap “Recents” to select your album from the bottom. You can also access this by clicking the “+” on your profile avatar
