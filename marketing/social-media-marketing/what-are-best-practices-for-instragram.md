# What are best practices for Instragram?

## One week from going live

* Introduce Popshop Live to your existing social followers and the wider community, whether in a post or video with a call to action like, “Download & follow me on Popshop Live.”
* Post your preview video on Instagram to encourage followers to tune in. Tag your community and ask them to share it in their story for a shoutout repost from you.
* Consider incentives like “free shipping” or a “giveaway”. You could also offer a discount when followers sign-up with a promotion code and watch your show.
* Send a personal invite to your existing customers via text in an effort to make them feel special – consider letting them know that your first debut show is private for your VIPs.
* Start an Instagram story and use the “Swipe Up” function to link to your preview video. Repost followers who have shared your preview video.&#x20;
* Add a countdown timer for your PSL Show
