# How do I get referrals? What is my invite code?

Growing your following is the secret to growing your business on Popshop Live. For new sellers, we recommend promoting your store and upcoming shows with existing customers and ask them to follow you on Popshop Live as a simple way to start and build an audience. Sharing your unique referral code is the best way to do this!

&#x20;

**Getting your unique referral code:**

* This 6-digit code can be found in the Popshop Live app. Once shared and a customer enters the code the first time they sign in they will automatically follow you and go right to your store!
* You can find your referral code in your "Store Settings" under "Profile"

* To change your referral code please reach out to your Account Manager

**Share unique code on social media**

* Before you go live, post on your IG story with PSL pre-made templates and mention your code as well as the date and time you're going live.

**Share your unique code with your friends and family via text**

* Text your family and friends the link to your promo video, we find that friends and family hype sellers up the most which draws a bigger crowd and attention to your shows.
