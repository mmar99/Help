# How can I send a promo code to an individual customer?

Promo codes have been demonstrated to be an effective conversion tool on Popshop Live.&#x20;

With the update made in March 2022, you are now able to create a promo code and assign that specific code to an individual customer. This can be done on your [Seller Dashboard](https://dashboard.popshop.live/store/promo). Once created the customer will be notified and it will automatically be added to their promo bin.&#x20;

### To create a promo code:

1. Head to Seller Dashboard > Store > [Promo ](https://dashboard.popshop.live/store/promo)
2. Click on "Add a new"
3. Start by creating a 6-Character code of your choosing and then selecting "Give to individual users"

4. Input Name, Description discount amount, start/end date, and any other parameter you would like then click "Create"

   2. Reminder ⚠️ :  Be sure to set the correct END DATE. If a customer already has the coupon they will be able to use it even if the coupon is set to "inactive". The best way to make sure the coupon will not be used is by setting the end date correctly.&#x20;
5. To send to a customer during your live show, head back to the  ["Show" Tab](https://dashboard.popshop.live/store/shows), select the show, click "viewers" then "Send Promo" next to the name of the customer\

6. To send to a customer when you are offline (not in a live show) head to the "customer" tab, **click FILL THIS PART OUT ONCE ITS LIVE**
7. Enter the code you would like to send to that customer and click "Confirm"

8. The code will automatically show up in the customer's Promo Bin as well

### Use case:&#x20;

This feature can be used in many ways, so use your imagination! One example could be if you want to drive attendance for the following show. Once you schedule your follow-up show you can go back and find the viewers from the previous show and send them a loyalty coupon code. The great thing about it is when they receive the code (if they have their notifications turned on) it will take them to the preview of the following show, giving you more exposure and an opportunity to sell what is on your Store Favorites.&#x20;

Feel free to let us know how you use this feature! Sharing is caring.&#x20;
