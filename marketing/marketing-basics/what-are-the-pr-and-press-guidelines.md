# What are the PR and press guidelines?

At Popshop Live, we value our sellers’ enthusiasm for talking about their business and educating others about our platform. We also want to enable our sellers to share stories to grow their business, so we’ve compiled this PR guide to support you through any interactions with the media. If you are speaking to the press or making any comment or statement regarding your Popshop store that will be public-facing, please refer to the below guidelines.

**General Guidelines**

* First, _**always notify Popshop’s PR team**_ if reporters reach out to you / if you plan to engage with them by sending an email to our PR agency at popshop@thehatchagency.com. This helps us be prepared for any related media inquiries that could be coming our way.
  * If you need any support answering media questions, please include an ask when flagging the opportunity.
* Please ensure it’s clear that you are speaking on behalf of yourself/business, and not Popshop as a company with media and at events.
* For any reporter questions specific to Popshop and our business, please direct them to our PR team at the above email.

**DO**

* Be authentic and share your enthusiasm about your experience selling on Popshop
* Feel free to reach out to our PR team with questions before you respond to reporters
* Ask reporters for more details about their story and deadline before agreeing to an interview
* Assume everything is on the record and what you say can be quoted
* Feel comfortable saying “No” – **it’s OK to decline interview requests and/or specific questions,** especially if it feels too personal or revealing. Leverage phrases such as:
  * “Thanks for your interest, however I’m unable to participate in an interview at this time.”
  * “That’s not something we share publicly” or “I’m not comfortable sharing that.”
  * “I can’t speak to that, so I’d recommend you reach out to Popshop’s team.”

**DO NOT**

* Say or share anything that you do not want to be made public – reporters will not let you change your mind or take something out of a story after the fact
* Share any internal Popshop materials (seller guide, demos, seller dashboard) with reporters without getting prior consent from our PR team
* Reveal any non-public information about Popshop without our approval (e.g. events or campaigns you may be participating in, but are not yet announced; other information about Popshop’s business that is only available to sellers)

**Navigating Questions About Financial Success**

* You can share (or not share) your shop’s financials at your own discretion. Feel free to run the details by our PR team and ask for our thoughts before sharing.
* Some sellers may be more comfortable sharing a subset of financials – such as how much you made during a particular show or how much your sales have grown over a period of time, using percentages and other metrics versus firm dollar amounts.
  * “We don’t share X (e.g. revenues), but I can tell you Y (e.g. other metrics that help demonstrate our business growth)”
