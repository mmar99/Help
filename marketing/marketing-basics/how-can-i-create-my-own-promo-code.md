Creating your own promo code is very easy!

### To create a promo code:

1. Head to Seller Dashboard > Store > [Promo ](https://dashboard.popshop.live/store/promo)
2. Click on "Add a new"
3. Start by creating a 6-Character code of your choosing and filling out the specifications of your coupon code

   2. Reminder: You will need to "set visible" for this promo code to be live. If you click on "Give to individual users" you will be able to send it to specific audience members and if you do not click on that the coupon will be open to everyone.&#x20;
4. Input Name, Description discount amount, start/end date, and any other parameter you would like then click "Create"

   2. Reminder ⚠️ :  Be sure to set the correct END DATE. If a customer already has the coupon they will be able to use it even if the coupon is set to "inactive". The best way to make sure the coupon will not be used is by setting the end date correctly. **Please note that promo codes do NOT work with customers using Apple Pay so please keep that in mind.**&#x20;
