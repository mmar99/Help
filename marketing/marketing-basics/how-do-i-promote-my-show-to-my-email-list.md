# How do I promote my show to my email list?

**Share your invite code through email**

* For any seller with an email list, sending an email blast can be a great way to get in front of your audience and drive new sign-ups. When considering email marketing, whether you are sending one email or a sequence of emails, here are a few things to remember. First, identify your Call To Action “CTA”. Your CTA is the action you want your prospect/audience to take after seeing your email. For example, if your goal is to drive sign-ups then crafting your email to fit that goal is imperative. Make sure your invite code is clearly visible and include easy instructions.
* Next is your offer. When sending an email, it’s important to remember to give your audience a reason to continue reading and take action. Crafting an offer that is valuable to your audience and time-sensitive will lay the foundation for a great email campaign.
* When combining these two key elements your email should have the structure needed to be effective! While these are not the only elements of a successful email campaign, they are the most important. In addition to email structure, keep in mind the size of your email list. As your list begins to grow you may consider prioritizing email marketing over other channels depending on your success.
