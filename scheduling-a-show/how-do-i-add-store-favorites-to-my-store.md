# How do I add store favorites to my store?

Store Favorites are product listings that live on your Store Front and can be viewed and purchased by your customers outside of your live shows. We recommend all sellers list a few Store Favorites to keep customers engaged in your Store in between your live shows.

Once a product listing has been added to your "[Inventory](https://help.popshop.live/hc/en-us/articles/4404985737625)", you can make it a "Store Favorites". Be sure to **optimize your item's titles** to easily be found if a customer is searching for an item. We have a great search option that allows customers to search for accounts, products, and shows.
