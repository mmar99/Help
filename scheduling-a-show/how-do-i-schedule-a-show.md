# How do I schedule a show?

⚡️We recommend scheduling your shows at least 7 days in advance to allow time for customers to add it to their watchlist, and for you to promote it with customers outside of Popshop Live.⚡️

### To schedule a show:

1\) Go to your store profile by tapping on your profile photo. Tap the clock icon to the right of your profile image:

2\) From there you will be taken to a **"View Preview"** window that will allow you to add a preview video. Your preview video is a trailer for your upcoming show. Your followers will see it in the Discover row and it will appear in your store profile. In 15-seconds or less, mention the time and day of the show, describe what your show will be about, and invite people to add your show to their watchlist in the app.

_⚡️Note: You can record your preview video using the Popshop Live app, or can upload a video from Photos on your iOS device (this allows you to add graphics and edits to your video).⚡️_

3\) Once the preview video is added you will be able to add a **cover photo** for your show. A cover photo is a thumbnail for your show and what customers tap to see your preview video. Use the Popshop Live app, or upload a photo from Photos on your iOS device.

_⚡️Note: if you encounter an error with show preview videos or cover photos, make sure you allow Popshop Live access to Camera and Photos by going to Settings > Privacy > Camera and toggling Popshop Live to "On." To upload a video, go to Settings > Privacy > Photos and toggle Popshop Live to "Selected Photos" or "All Photos."⚡️_

4\) Next up will be adding **"Show info"** where you'll be able to add the finishing touches to your show like:

* **Show name -** this is the title for your show, seen by customers. Use a short, descriptive title (10 words or less).
* **Schedule** - this is the date and time in your local time zone for your upcoming show.
* **Visibility**- here you can pick if you want this to be in "practice mode" or a live show.&#x20;
  * turning on **Practice Mode** will allow you to create a preview that is not visible on Popshop Live, except via a direct link provided in the app. Practice Mode is useful to familiarize yourself with the Popshop Live app before making your shows public. If you create a scheduled show in practice mode or public, it cannot be changed later.
* **Event & Row** - If you are scheduling a show for a specific PSL event or Category Row here is where you will be able to add it. Please note that you need to apply and be accepted to the event before you can add it to the show.&#x20;
  * ⚠️ If you have been accepted to an event please be sure to select that event while scheduling your show otherwise you will **not** be able to participate in that space and/or take advantage of any promotions associated with the event. If you do not see the event while scheduling please email [Seller@popshop.live](mailto:Seller@popshop.live) ⚠️
