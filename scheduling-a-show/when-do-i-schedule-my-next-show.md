# When do I schedule my next show?

To build an audience over time and to grow your sales and business on Popshop Live, we recommend that sellers go live frequently (weekly is recommended). Streaming on a consistent day of the week and time can help your customers know when to tune in.

_We generally recommend scheduling your next show before your current live show starts. This allows you to tell your audience about it, answer any of their questions about it, and you can ask them to add it to their watchlist._
