When creating a cover photo or preview video it's important to take into consideration the layout. We recommend using our templates below.&#x20;

This is a safespace image layer. Just add the layer on top of your design or video & turn the opacity down, that will help you figure out what will be cut out.  Keep in mind that not all phones are the same but for the majority of the images will work if you use the template. One image is for cover photos and the other is for preview videos the sizing is 1080x1920.&#x20;
