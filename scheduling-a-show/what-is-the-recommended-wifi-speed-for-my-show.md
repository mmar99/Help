# What is the recommended wifi speed for my show?

Wifi speed is **VITAL** to your shows so we recommend that you check out what your speed is **PRIOR** to your first show or if you are going to stream from a new location.&#x20;

Head over to [Fast.com](https://fast.com/) and run the test. There are three metrics that show (PINGs, Download Speed and Upload Speed) but you only need to worry about the Upload speed for your streams.&#x20;

In order for your show to stream efficiently we suggest that the upload speed is HIGHER than 8 Mbps (megabits per second).&#x20;

If your upload speed is lower than the suggested 8 Mbps we recommend to either contact your internet provider or increase the speed.&#x20;
