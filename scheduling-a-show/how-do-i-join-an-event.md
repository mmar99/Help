# How do I join an event?

Events are a great opportunity to grow your store on Popshop Live! They show up as dedicated pages and spaces on the Popshop Live app and showcase the participating stores’ live shows. We promote and advertise Popshop Live events across our channels, to our followers, and to our existing community of sellers and customers. Each event has a theme (i.e. Artist Alley) and a dedicated start and end time.

To participate in an event, you must apply and be accepted to the event. Some events on Popshop Live are stand-alone (like May 4th Event) and others are recurring (Artist Alley is every Monday from 1-5 PM PST). Once you apply and are accepted to a particular recurring event, you are able to participate in any of its future iterations.

**Applying for an event on Seller Dashboard**&#x20;

Currently, all of our upcoming events can be found in the Seller Resource Center. Check back periodically for new and upcoming events. You can find out where to apply under the event card.

**Getting accepted to participate in an event**

Popshop Live considers a number of factors on whether or not a seller can participate in an event. This includes tenure on Popshop Live (including how many shows the seller has hosted), whether the seller’s account is in good standing with Popshop Live, and whether or not their content and products align with the theme of the event. If you are accepted as a participating seller, you will receive a confirmation email with more details.

**Note:** for recurring events (like Farmer’s Market and Artist Alley), once you are approved to participate you can create shows in any future event. We ask that sellers who are approved to participate in a recurring event do so at least once a month to remain eligible for events.

**Creating a preview show in the event space**

We make the event space visible to sellers before we make the event public for all customers to see in the app. Once there are multiple preview videos from sellers in the event space we will make the event public.

Only approved sellers can place their preview videos into the event space. To do so, create a preview video using the Popshop Live app, and when you select the date and time, make sure the date and time you select aligns with the event (if the event is Monday June 1st from 10 - 2 PM PST, select a start time within this window). On the next screen, you will see the event option listed. Click the event, finish posting your preview video, and it will be placed in the event space.

**Note:** for recurring events, we create the next event space once the current event ends. For instance, if you are an Artist Alley seller, you will see the event space available to schedule your next show right after the current Artist Alley event is completed.

**Going live in the event space**

On the day of your live show, you will see the event space featuring participating stores’ live shows. When going live, select the event name to place your show in the event. The Popshop Live team will be monitoring the event to make sure your show is placed in the event space.
