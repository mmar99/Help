# How do I edit or delete a scheduled show?

After scheduling a show, it will appear in your [Seller Dashboard](https://dashboard.popshop.live/) under Store > Shows. You will see all of your upcoming and prior shows, and you can edit details by tapping on "Edit."

⚡️Note: You can only edit your upcoming show on the seller Dashboard⚡️

Scheduled shows will also appear in the Popshop Live app under "My Shows." To **DELETE** a scheduled show, tap on the three dots on the bottom right-hand side of the show card, and a window will appear with the option to Start the show or Delete it.

⚡️Note: This action cannot be undone once deleted⚡️

When you schedule a show, it creates a unique show URL that you can promote to your existing customers outside of Popshop Live. To find the link fo to the preview video and tap on the "share" button at the top right corner. A menu at the bottom of the screen will pop up with sharing options.

**Scheduling multiple shows** - scheduling multiple shows is an advanced feature that is good for specific show formats, and doing so during the same time window allows your followers to get notified when the new show starts. This is a great way to drop limited products or notify your followers of interesting things that may happen during your show.&#x20;

_⚡️We do not recommend that new sellers schedule multiple shows until they are confident in their ability to use the Popshop Live app, since scheduling multiple shows will send multiple notifications and could cause your followers to stop following you if done incorrectly.⚡️_
