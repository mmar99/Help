### FAQs

Q: **What is the return/cancellation policy for items?**\
A: Due to the style of shopping and limited inventory, all sales are final. The checkout process is two steps for customers to see what was selected and to review the product they are purchasing before hitting the buy button. It's best to remind your customers of the no cancelations policy during the show.
