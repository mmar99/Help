### **Leveling up**

The top stores on Popshop Live focus on building their community, increasing engagement in their shows, and using our software and tools to increase the conversion rate. The secret to success in live stream shopping is continually bringing new audiences to your shows and doing everything you can to provide an awesome experience so that your existing audience keeps tuning in to future shows. For our top sellers, consistently have the highest number of referrals (their existing fans and community that they bring to Popshop Live), they stream often, and they retain up to 30% of their viewers from show to show. Lastly, they stream consistently (at least once per month, some stream once per week), building a habit loop for their community.

In order to level up your store on Popshop Live and unlock even more features and benefits, we set goals for new sellers to achieve that are in line with what we have seen work for other new sellers on Popshop Live. So what are the goals?

To level up, you need to:

1. Achieve 30 referrals on Popshop Live. Learn more about [referrals](https://help.popshop.live/hc/en-us/articles/4405462353305-How-do-I-get-referrals-What-is-my-invite-code-).
2. Stream for at least 4 hours in 30 days (an average of 1 show a week).
3. Maintain a speedy shipping rate (an average shipment speed of 2 business days). Learn more about [fulfilling orders](https://help.popshop.live/hc/en-us/articles/4405462193817-How-do-I-fulfill-orders-on-Seller-Dashboard-PSL-Shipping-) and shipping speed here.

Once you achieve these goals, your store is eligible to level up. The Popshop Live team will review your conduct, content, and other metrics and let you know if you have achieved this new status. If successful, your store is leveled up!

### **Stores that level up get even more benefits:**

1. A custom URL - like [www.popshop.live/i-love-dogs](http://www.popshop.live/i-love-dogs)&#x20;
2. Access to advanced analytics in Seller Dashboard
3. Ability to stream into categories for your store and participate in events
4. Your streams become visible to non-followers on our platform
5. You get the ‘seller’ badge next to your name in chat and in other parts of the platform

### **This sounds great! How do I get started?**

There are a few steps to getting started:

1. **Finish setting up your store** - be sure to add [tax](https://help.popshop.live/hc/en-us/articles/4405019155481-How-should-I-set-up-sales-tax-Who-is-responsible-for-the-sales-tax-) and [payout](https://help.popshop.live/hc/en-us/articles/4548988676495-How-can-I-update-or-edit-my-Bank-account-info-) information, decide what [shipping method](https://help.popshop.live/hc/en-us/articles/4556580855183-PSL-Shipping-vs-Own-Shipping-which-one-is-best-for-me-) you prefer to use, and complete up your seller profile with unique information about your store like your picture, your store name, and [bio](https://help.popshop.live/hc/en-us/articles/4405286039577-How-do-I-edit-my-store-profile-and-information-).
2. **Create your inventory** - this can be done in bulk using import files in Seller Dashboard, automatically if you use Shopify by leveraging [Shopify Sync](https://help.popshop.live/hc/en-us/articles/4417441426713-How-do-I-link-Shopify-and-Popshop-Live-), or[ manually](https://help.popshop.live/hc/en-us/articles/4404985737625-How-can-I-bulk-upload-my-inventory-) using the Popshop Live app.

* [**Schedule a live show** ](https://help.popshop.live/hc/en-us/articles/4405286081049-How-do-I-schedule-a-show-)**and make a** [**preview video-**](https://help.popshop.live/hc/en-us/articles/4420318267791-What-are-best-practices-for-creating-a-cover-photo-Preview-video-) for new sellers, we recommend scheduling a show at least 7-10 days in advance. This will help you plan for your show and also gives you time to get your referrals up and [promote your show](https://help.popshop.live/hc/en-us/articles/4845672136719-New-seller-marketing-playbook). We have never seen a successful show on Popshop Live from a new seller who doesn’t market their show and plan in advance.
* **Practice going live using practice mode -** you can use all of the same features you will use when your show goes live (is available to your followers) in practice mode. We have never seen a new seller have success without first using practice mode to learn how to maneuver and learn the platform.
