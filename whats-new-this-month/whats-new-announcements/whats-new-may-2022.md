# Whats New - May 2022

### **Mobile/Web Feature Updates**

**Update Bank info** -  ****  you can now update your bank information through the Seller Dashboard, [here](https://dashboard.popshop.live/finances/payments). Once you submit the update you will receive a confirmation email from our team, so be sure to keep an eye out for it!

**New “Transaction” tab -** we have launched the “Transactions” tab in [Seller Dashboard](https://dashboard.popshop.live/finances/payments/transactions), which can be found under Finance/Payments. The transactions tab is an aggregated view of your orders, clearly displaying all taxes, promos, and fees applied which result in your payout amount for that order. You can also export this information to an excel file.

**New “Viewers” tab** - you now have access to the viewers watching your shows on your “Show Detail” page in [Seller Dashboard](https://dashboard.popshop.live/store/shows). The data refreshes near real-time, and you can see how long a user viewed the show, their total likes/comments/shares, and total product sales in that show. You can also filter this list down for users that are new followers in that show, new customers, repeat customers, new viewers, or repeat viewers.

**Transaction details added to the order detail page** - when viewing a specific order you can now see a detailed breakdown of your transaction on the [Seller Dashboard](https://dashboard.popshop.live/orders/all). In the orders tab, you can click “view” under “Actions” and that will open up a full breakdown of that purchase. Additionally, if you export your shows to a CSV you'll be able to see all that detail as well.&#x20;

**Patreon: patron-only live shows -** you now have the ability to host a patron-only live show on Popshop Live. This is a unique and fun way for you to engage with your subscribing fans on Patreon. The Patreon subscriber (called a patron) can sign in to PSL using their Patreon account. Any seller can use this feature, just be sure to email seller@popshop.live and request this feature to be turned on in your store. For more information check out [this article](https://help.popshop.live/hc/en-us/articles/4692948968207)&#x20;

**Standardizing sales metrics -**  previously on the [Seller Dashboard](https://dashboard.popshop.live/), we had used a few disjointed terms (revenue, gross revenue, total, earnings, GMV, total GMV, etc.) to display your total sales. We have standardized these into one metric called “Product Sales” which represents the \[total quantity X listing price of your products sold] to make it consistent across our platform.&#x20;

**Submit ‘Merchant Category Code’ -** in order to generate an accurate 1099 report you can now submit your merchant category code (MCC) on your [Seller Dashboard](https://dashboard.popshop.live/finances/taxes/documents). Moving forward if no MCC is selected, we will place you into a 5262 (”Marketplaces”) by default.

**Our Shopify Sync now supports 3rd party app inventory locations -** previously, we integrated with only physical inventory locations. Now, we can integrate and sync with 3rd party app locations. This unlocks sellers who use 3rd party logistics (3PL). It also unlocks new use cases, like creators who use apps like Printful to print on demand.
