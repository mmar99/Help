# Whats New- October 2021

### **Mobile/Web Feature Updates**

We launched two new features in the Seller Dashboard - Picklists to assist with packing and fulfilling orders and Seller Referrals! Read more below.

#### **Picklist**

Our new Picklist option can help you with your fulfillment workflows.

A picklist is a list of items sold from your show (but isn’t grouped by customer, or order). It will be a list of items with the quantities you sold of each item during your show.

If you keep your inventory separately from where you pack orders, or you simply prefer to do it this way, you can go grab the total quantities you need for each item from the picklist. Then when you have everything in your packing area, you can use the packing slips to grab the items that belong together. This can save you valuable time from going back and forth picking orders one-by-one

Once the orders are packed, use the optional ‘Mark as packed’ option to help you keep track of what’s been picked and packed. Use these tools to speed up your fulfillment process and get your customers their items faster.

Find the new picklist by going to one of your shows at this link: [https://dashboard.popshop.live/orders/shows](https://dashboard.popshop.live/orders/shows).&#x20;

The Picklist button is in the top right and will download as an Excel sheet you can print and take with you!

#### **Refer a seller**

Refer some seller friends to help them cut the line for selling on Popshop Live.

We just launched a new feature on the Seller Dashboard where you can refer a seller or store that would be great to sell on Popshop Live. When you fill out the form, it goes right to the front of the stack for our sales team to reach out and help them onboard onto our app. Plus, when you refer another seller, we will thank you with $100 in cash for every referred seller that completes their first show!

Check it out and submit your first referral by clicking the ‘Refer a seller’ option at the bottom of the left-hand menu.
