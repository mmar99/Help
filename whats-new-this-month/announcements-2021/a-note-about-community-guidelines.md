# A note about Community Guidelines

**July 2021**

To our Popshop Live Seller Community,

We have received reports of seller disputes over the last month. People feel hurt, and we are disheartened to see and hear that.

As a young startup with only 25 people, we are very hands-on with all our operations and feel personally connected with every seller on our platform. Through this dispute, it is our responsibility to seek a resolution and define our philosophy and guidelines around our community for all our users who depend on us with their livelihood, passion, and brand.

We built Popshop Live to empower sellers to build an eCommerce business and engage with a community of buyers interested in supporting small businesses. We believe we bring in some of the best sellers who are both creative and deeply caring, and we are grateful for all the sellers who have been actively building a positive community for the customers with us. We believe in the best in people and hope that encouraging positive behaviors and active listening will help create an empathetic environment.

We understand the importance of bringing more clarity with regard to what our principles are and what we will not tolerate. We are sending this email today to shed light on this for full transparency, and to begin a discussion with you. We will continue to listen, learn, improve, and share with you.

**Guidelines & Immediate Action**

First, we have been in discussions with the parties affected in the aforementioned disputes. We first sought understanding since we believed there could have been a misunderstanding. After numerous conversations, we are currently working with our legal team to craft community guidelines and a code of conduct that we will be requiring **all sellers** to sign before going live in the future. We believe that to benefit every seller in the community. These guidelines and code of conduct will have consequences if breached. The reported parties will be suspended immediately until the aforementioned items are agreed to and signed by them. In the meantime, we continue to seek understanding with the involved parties.

**Zero Tolerance for Hate**

We do not tolerate discrimination and defamation of any kind, including but not limited to hate speech, racism, violence, etc. (to be more clearly defined in the guidelines) against other sellers, customers, and Popshop Live team members. If you have any behavior that you would like to report (now or in the future), please do so by emailing report@popshop.live. We have also received reports from various customers on Popshop Live, and will be offering them this avenue in the future as well.

**Our Commitment**

In the past few months, a few companies have been approaching our sellers to offer what they call similar tools. We did not want to react to it, but it is important for us to address our focus and commitment to you directly. Our commitment is to build the best livestream selling tools that empower sellers to connect with their customers, and for customers to discover sellers and shows. We are here to support sellers, provide training, and help them thrive. Our focus is in creating the best shopping experience for your customers, keeping our operation efficient, providing powerful and accessible tools and services, and continuing to recruit a world class team to build a platform that grows as you grow.

**Empathy**

We are being very cautious about exercising a ban. We have never used it before and believe it should only be used as a last resort. We ask for empathy towards sellers whose livelihoods depend on Popshop Live regardless of size. That said, moving forward, warnings, suspensions, and other instruments will be used as necessary to align sellers with our guidelines.

**Show Monitoring**

Before we build the tools that will empower the community to moderate their own live shows, our team will be closely monitoring shows in the next few months. Additionally, we will rely on the community for feedback and to report breaches of conduct.

If you have any questions for us, please feel free to reach out by emailing support@popshop.live.

Thank you,

The Popshop Live Team
