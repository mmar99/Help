# Whats New- November 2021

### **Mobile/Web Feature Updates**

We launched two new features in the Seller Dashboard - Read more below

1. **New feature for customers-** Toggle liking bolts on or off during live shows. Full article [here](https://help.popshop.live/hc/en-us/articles/4407912574745)
2. **Update to Auction Features-** In October we launched auction timer - a new feature to help you run your auctions more smoothly and help you pick a winner! Now, when you start a new auction, you can choose whether or not to add a timer. If you add a timer, customers will see a fun animation as the timer counts down. During the very last part of the auction, every bid that a customer places will add a little more time to the clock. When the clock runs out for good, the highest bidder wins!

3. **New Pickup option for purchases**-We just launched a new feature for sellers who want to offer their local customers pickup. Now, at checkout, your customers will see the option to toggle their shipping address to ‘local pickup.’ They won’t be charged shipping, and their order will be marked for ‘Pickup’ in our ordering system.
