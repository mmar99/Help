**Financial research calls:** it has been brought to our attention that there are some financial research firms soliciting our sellers for information on PSL. To confirm, PSL is not at all affiliated with these companies, please be careful about sharing your information.

**Update to Featured Products:** we have changed the name of ‘Featured Products’ to ‘Store Favorites’. Add up to 10 Store Favorite product listings. These products can be found via your storefront and on your preview video at all times so that customers can shop from your store even when you’re not live.

**Pro tip:**  You can change these items as often as you like via Seller Dashboard. These listings will not appear in your live show catalog.

**Instagram eliminates swipe-up links for stories**: Instagram is testing the removal of their swipe-up feature. It’s essential that you place your store URL in your Instagram bio (or linktree) to ensure your community can access your shows directly. We also encourage adding the [PSL badge](https://www.notion.so/Website-Badges-c5e64d1b501540178d49b157b372ba74) to your website.
