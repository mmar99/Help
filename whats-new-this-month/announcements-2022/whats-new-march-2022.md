# Whats New - March 2022

### **Mobile/Web Feature Updates**

**Bulk inventory updates -** on [Seller Dashboard](https://dashboard.popshop.live/) you are now able to export your product listings, update your items on the CSV file, then upload that file back to your [Seller Dashboard](https://dashboard.popshop.live/). This will override the existing product listings so be sure to **ONLY** edit product listings you need to edit. To export, head to [Seller Dashboard > Store > Inventory](https://dashboard.popshop.live/store/listings) > “Export”**.** For more info check out [this article](https://help.popshop.live/hc/en-us/articles/4438829564313)

**Shopify Sync v2 update**

1. Faster and more reliable inventory syncing.
2. Importing the tag field. Syncing PSL orders back to Shopify and then pulling the tracking information back into PSL’s orders system.
3. It is no longer a requirement to create a new location for Popshop Live in Shopify to make onboarding easier.&#x20;

Point 3 is especially helpful for those of you that have integrations with third-party logistic providers via Shopify.

**Reviews improvements added to Seller Dashboard** - customer reviews can now be viewed via your [Seller Dashboard](https://dashboard.popshop.live/store/reviews) as well as in app on your Storefront.

**Clearer and more actionable “Orders” tab -** you can now view all “Main Orders”, which are grouped by “Show”, and then the “Items” tab displays each individual item purchased. We have also added packed and fulfillment statuses to the table as well as a date filter.

**Automatically move sold-out product listings to the bottom of the Show Catalog** - it’s optional, defaulted to OFF, and has to be configured for each show once you are in the green room on your [Seller Dashboard](https://dashboard.popshop.live/). Check out [this article](https://help.popshop.live/hc/en-us/articles/4420259263887) for more information.

**Live show greenrooms appear in Seller Dashboard** - this will help sellers add listings, turn on different settings, and prepare for the upcoming show using [Seller Dashboard](https://dashboard.popshop.live/) vs. the phone

**Promo codes - these do not work when a customer uses Apple Pay.**

### **Announcements**

**Community Stories - ”United by our love for music”**

We are so happy to bring you the first of our Community Stories series. Spotlighting Sarah of Forever Seesaw, this documentary is a look behind the K-Pop explosion and the prevalence of K-Pop Cup Sleeve events. From niche beginnings to worldwide acclaim, fan groups have followed K-Pop’s largest stars and found community along the way. Check out the full story, on our YouTube channel [here](https://youtu.be/vadLpS37jeI).

**Mystery  Boxes -**  we know that our community loves a mystery box!&#x20;

* Mystery boxes are essentially a mystery bundle of products, usually sold at a lower price than the overall retail value of all the included products.
* These not only make for an exciting show format but are a great way to convert new customers, drive engagement and social sharing, as well as help you move odd stock.
* Consider limiting units to create excitement and maybe including a chaser to make them even more attractive.
* You don't need to reveal what is in every box, but we recommend showing an example to the audience so that they know what to expect. Some customers might also like you to open their purchase live during the show - this can also be a great way to attract more sales.&#x20;

**Case Study:**

* 50% of the sellers first time customers bought a mystery box in the show
* 37% of the seller's repeat customers bought a mystery box in the show
* Mystery boxes drove 18% of the seller's total sales.
