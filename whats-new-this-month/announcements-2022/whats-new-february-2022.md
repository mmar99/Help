# Whats New - February 2022

### **Mobile/Web Feature Updates**

**Promo codes**- You can now choose to make your promo codes visible and/or set them so that only your followers can use them. For instance, you could make a promo code only for followers + and only for first-time users. Sellers can use this to incentivize a follow, since non-followers will see it in the promo bin, but won’t be able to redeem it unless they follow. The ‘set visible’ is the function that puts the code in the promo bin and removes the necessity for customers to type in anything at checkout!

**Ability to archive a listing** - You can now archive your listings. When a listing is archived, it doesn’t appear in your show catalog and can be filtered from your store inventory. As part of this release, we also launched logic where SKU becomes the unique identifier for a listing. No two listings can have the same SKU moving forward.

**Inventory list view in Seller Dashboard -** As we scale the number of listings sellers manage, the grid view for inventory becomes more arduous to use. So we launched list view with in-line editing to manage your inventory.&#x20;

**Adding missed invites or referrals -** in the latest app version (3.40) we made it so that customers can add a missing invitation or referral. To use this feature, direct customers to go to Profile > Referrals and click on “Did Someone Invite You to PopShop Live.” Enter the link that was shared, or the invite code in order to associate their account with who invited them (either you or another customer).

### &#x20;**Announcements**
