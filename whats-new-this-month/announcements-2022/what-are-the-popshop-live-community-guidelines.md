# What are the Popshop Live Community Guidelines?

## **PSL Community Guidelines (V.1)**

### **Welcome to Popshop Live!**

Popshop Live welcomes and celebrates an eclectic community of sellers and customers with various interests and diverse backgrounds on our platform. If it weren't for your high spirits and community togetherness, PSL would not be the dynamic app we are today. We are focused on amplifying this positive, yet realistic spirit as we grow. For this, we will need your help!

To ensure Popshop Live is a safe space for all our users, we are implementing new community guidelines and encouraging our community to help foster the best PSL experience possible. Please take your time to read through the Popshop Live Community Guidelines below.

### **We have a diverse community. You can help us make it inclusive for all members.**

#### **Have fun**

People come to Popshop to have fun. Let’s keep it light-hearted, and assume the best in others.

#### **Spread Love**

Support each other and lift each other up. Sellers are entertaining their community and selling unique products. This requires authenticity and vulnerability. Likewise, our members make our community valuable and rewarding when they can authentically engage in the chat and with the seller knowing that Popshop is a safe space for all. We ask that you support each other across all parts of the Popshop platform.

#### **Keep each other accountable**

Popshop Live is working on tools to empower the community to monitor and moderate shows on our platform. These tools will allow anyone to report any activity that violates our Community Guidelines. Today, we rely on our audience and some of our team to be the active monitors during Popshop Live shows. If there is a community member or seller that you don't believe is following our community guidelines, please report the transgression and any evidence to report@popshop.live.

### **What Popshop is For**

Our community continues to grow weekly with new and curious shoppers interested in what live-streaming selling is all about. Part of their Popshop Live journey is to meet the curators

#### **Creative, entertaining, and inspiring content**

Our goal is to provide a platform for sellers to create entertaining content, inspired by creativity. The features we build, the culture we’ve created, and the things we do daily are in service of this.

#### **Curious customers**

Our community continues to grow weekly with new and curious shoppers interested in what live-streaming selling is all about. Part of their Popshop Live journey is to meet the curators, subject-matter experts, makers, and community-builders. They want to know the story behind the products and support the businesses.

#### **Sellers who care**

Popshop Live sellers are some of the most creative and caring individuals. They want to share their passion and genuinely connect with their customers.

#### **Authentic and unique Products**

On Popshop Live, you can discover products that are hard to discover otherwise. List Items with integrity: all information associated with your Popshop Live listings should be accurate and honest.

#### **Respectful Conversations and Engagement**

It’s everyone’s responsibility to help ensure that the tone of a show — whether live or in the comments — stays positive and welcoming for all. Use our Popshop Live in-app features with respect. We do not condone excessive spamming of a show's chat, phishing, use of autobots, or illegal tampering with show data.

### **What is Popshop Not For**

#### **No Harassment and Defamation**

Do not organize, participate in, or encourage harassment and defamation of others. Disagreements happen and are to be expected, however, continuous, repetitive, defamatory or severe negative comments are not acceptable.

#### **No Bullying**

No bullying or negative language (racist or sexist remarks, prejudiced comments, sexual advances, peer slander, etc.) about other sellers, customers, or community members during a broadcast (on camera or in the comment chat).

#### **No Breaking Confidentiality**

There is no sharing of private personal identifying information (PII) of anyone in the community on our platform. Limit the sharing of personal identifying information while live.

#### **No Hate Speech**

Do not organize, promote, or coordinate hate speech on the platform. It’s unacceptable to attack a person or a community based on attributes such as their race, ethnicity, national origin, sex, gender, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, or disabilities.

#### **No Violence or Threats of Violence**

Violence is strictly prohibited during any show on our platform. Do not make threats of violence or threaten to harm others or self. This includes indirect threats, as well as sharing or threatening to share someone’s private personal information. Please report any incidents of violence or threats of violence as soon as possible to report@popshop.live.

#### **No Illegal Content**

In general, you should not promote, encourage or engage in any illegal behavior.

### **Respect the Platform & Community Interventions**

Healthy communities are those where participants engage in good faith, and with an assumption of good faith for others. Popshop Live may, at its discretion, intervene to end a show or suspend an account when it believes it is in the best interest of the community or the platform. This should happen rarely, but when it does, our goal is to keep the platform inclusive and give the seller a chance to cool off and become compliant with our guidelines.

If issues continue to occur, Popshop Live may step in with actions to resolve issues. \*\*\*\*Next steps will be assessed and sometimes pure education of the party involved will help, but these actions could potentially include warnings, show monitoring and moderating, account suspension, as well as account deletion. We hope permanent actions will never become necessary, but we reserve the right to take such actions when extreme situations warrant them.

### **General Warning**

For a first violation, offenders will receive a written warning and their show will be marked for 'special show monitoring' for each broadcast over the span of 14 days. If no further violations are made during this period, the account will be removed from this list. If there are repeat violations during a live broadcast, we will be forced to pause/suspend the offender's live show and restrict future streaming/selling privileges on our platform.

#### **Streaming Suspension**

If we deem a violation as offensive or poor-spirited, we will suspend streaming privileges on our platform. The duration is case-by-case (based on the severity of the violations), but can last between 1-30 days.

#### **Muting** **Comments**

If a seller or shopper posts back-to-back comments, spam, and/or creates an uncomfortable atmosphere for the PSL Community, the comments of the user will be muted for the remainder of the broadcasts. If malicious violations are repeated, app usage restrictions for all PSL shows will be implemented indefinitely.

#### **General App Usage Restrictions**

This includes all Popshop Live functionalities: making a purchase, streaming, selling, commenting, bidding, adding shows to watchlist, and following sellers. The inactivity duration will be 1-30 days, depending on the type of violation. We will provide written notice when a restriction is lifted.

#### **App Usage Suspended Indefinitely**

If your Popshop Live account is suspended indefinitely, you will not be able to reinstate or reregister for another account. If we discover reregistration or receive reports from our community with evidence of registration, your new account will also be suspended indefinitely. If there are multiple infractions repeated, Popshop Live will also place the associated account and user under suspension indefinitely.

#### **Understanding the Layers of Emotion**

While we are aiming for the perfect vibes on our platform, let's keep it real; Human emotion is a very complex and layered topic. Our sellers place themselves in a very vulnerable position to be so open and transparent with our community. Also, our community (sellers and buyers) all possess real feelings, so it takes a tribe effort to create a space where feelings are not intentionally hurt. Making mistakes is inevitable. However, practicing efforts like accepting accountability, utilizing apologetic communication efforts, and leading by a positive example are all ways that create a great community atmosphere. At Popshop Live, we have the chance to break past the social stereotypes set in place during the last decade of streaming influence and create the progressive, solution-oriented community we've all desired.

#### **MISC**

Treat every seller and community member with equity while using any in-app communication option provided by PSL (this includes audio dialogue while streaming live, the show comment section, and the preview comment section).

### **We respect you. Prioritize Self-Care**

Prioritize Self-Care. Remember, our ideal PSL spirit is of joy, wellness, and togetherness. Lots of life can occur outside of our platform, so it is our responsibility to self-analyze and ensure we are fit to participate in in-app facilities prior to logging in. If and when you're not feeling yourself mentally or physically before a show, we recommend that you take some time for yourself. Sellers; we can always work with you to communicate any show cancellations if needed.
