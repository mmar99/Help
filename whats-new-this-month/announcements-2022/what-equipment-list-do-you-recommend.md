* Make sure to disable dropbox / google drive or any other applications that may be running in the background while you’re streaming.

#### **Ringlight + Tripod (lighting)**

#### **Charger**

_Make sure your phone is fully charged before the show starts. Low battery (dropping below 20%) will affect your stream. Charging your phone at under 20% is a lot harder to charge and your phone will have to work harder. Highly recommended having it charged the whole show._

#### **Background / Set suggestions**

_If you’re streaming during the day be mindful of the sun and where and when the light comes through your window. This will / may effect you so plan for a spot for you to move to when that happens._

* No clutter in the background
* Shelf with Products
* Showing off items on a desk, make sure you have a clean desk
* Avoid wearing white (Your shirt might blend in with the chatbox)
* (Optional) If you’re playing music make sure to test audio before hand and mark the volume setting so your voice isn’t drowned out by the music. Also please play royalty free music.
* (Optional) Multiple sets / backdrops where you can move your tripod around to give the audience you’re in a new area and its a new show.

#### **Sound**

This is a 3 channel mixer. If your shows often feature three or more people on camera, the same company also makes a 6 channel version. Making sure your on-camera talent is using a microphone is key to ensuring that background noise doesn’t distract from your show and the products you’re featuring. A mixer allows several people to be mic-ed and it allows the levels to be adjusted separately for quiet talkers and yellers alike.&#x20;
