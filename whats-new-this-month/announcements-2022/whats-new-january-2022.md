# Whats New - January 2022

**Happy New Year, PSL family! We hope that you had a relaxing holiday, and can already feel the pulse of the new year! It’s a great time for taking stock, setting goals, and making resolutions to be the kind of business you want to be! We’re ringing in the new year with new features, and this article is all about helping you make the most of them.**

### **Mobile/Web Feature Updates**

**Seller Profile Update -** Anyone can now pull up a seller’s profile from anywhere inside the app. Users will have easy-to-navigate access to your bio, shows, store favorites, and reviews.\
\
**Product Reviews-** With the seller profiles being updated, users will be able to see all product reviews. If you do not have any yet, we highly recommend starting to request them from happy customers.

### **Announcements**

**Gifting Feature -** Customers can now buy a gift on the live stream and send it to friends. Similarly, sellers can gift items to Livestream viewers. [Here](https://popshop.live/upcomingShow\_kHmEMWFCg4i56mwXsFaa) is a quick user guide on how to send a gift.\
\
**Archive a listing -** SKU listings will be able to be archived so you don't have duplicates. You will be able to hide the item from all views but retain its data and keep the same listing ID. \
\
**Promo Bin -** We have a new and fast way for your users to redeem your promotions without needing to enter a promo code. \
\
**Keep your sold items organized** - With the new Pickup option, customers can now decide to pick items up at an event or trade show rather than have them delivered. Easily separate what needs to be shipped, and what needs to be delivered with our CSV file. Tap [here](https://dashboard.popshop.live/orders/shows/pickup) on the Pickup tab of your Dashboard, select the show you would like to export, and on the top right corner, you’ll be able to export the list of items that have been selected for pickup.\
\
**Check on “Live” status of items -** during your live show you'll be able to quickly view which items in your inventory list are “live”. By going to [your shows](https://dashboard.popshop.live/store/shows) on the Dashboard and clicking on the Live show, you'll be able to get an overview of that show. If an item is in your show it will have a green “LIVE” button next to it. \
\
**Add any item from the standard inventory page to your live show -** on the [seller dashboard](https://dashboard.popshop.live/store/listings) you will be able to filter your inventory by tag, search, etc, and then quickly add the items to a current live show.&#x20;
