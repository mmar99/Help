# How do customers find my store?

**There are a few ways customers can find your store on Popshop Live:**

* In the search box under "Discover" or "Stores" on the main PSL discovery page, using your store name or seller referral code (new customers who input this code during their account sign up process are taken directly to your storefront)
* Via your unique store URL (found under the "Store" tab in [Seller Dashboard](https://dashboard.popshop.live/)).
* Customers on Popshop Live can add your shows to their Watchlist. This will allow them to watch the show and get notified when that show goes live.
* Your Popshop Live followers will see your upcoming and live shows in the "Discover" and "Live Now" sections.
* Your Popshop Live followers will be notified via push notification 5 minutes before you go live, and as you go live.

_When you first join Popshop Live we recommend promoting your show to your existing fans and audience in other channels (Instagram, Youtube, Facebook), promoting your shows in your physical store location, and inviting your existing customers and fans to follow you._

_Popshop Live also puts on regular events for sellers. Make sure to turn on notifications in the Popshop Live app to get notified when you are eligible to participate in an upcoming event._
